## I needed to manage a terraform deployment performed on a work 
## machine that I lost access to.

Luckily, I used a remote backend via Terraform Cloud and chose
to perform the work on an Ubuntu container. This is a script to get a working
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS environment with basic packages for Terraform and AWS 
administration pre-shipped.
